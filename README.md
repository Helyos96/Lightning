Super Scuffed Build planner for Path of Exile.

Needed something fun to do to learn Rust. Don't use this.

lightning-model is a framework for computing mods, stats, importing characters and a static data store.
lightning-app is a GL+imgui+winit UI.

```
$ cd lightning-app
$ cargo run
```

Thanks to RePoe (and zao's updated fork) for gems.json. And more json files once I can actually make use of them.
